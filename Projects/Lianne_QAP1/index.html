            <h2>Information</h2>
            <br>
            <p><span class=firstletter>T</span>he <b>painted bunting</b> <i>(Passerina ciris)</i> is a species of bird from the <strong>cardinal</strong> family, <dfn>Cardinalidae</dfn>.<br>
        It is a native bird species to North America. The <i>female</i> and <i>male</i> have distinct color difference, the first year of life they are both close in appearance with a green plumage. <br>
        In the second year of life the <i>males</i> will start to grow into the bright rainbow color that is easily distinguishable from the females, while they keep the green semblance from the first year. </p>

        <p>There are two recognized subspecies of the painted bunting.</p>
        <br>

       <ul>
        <li><b>P. c. ciris</b>  (<dfn>Linnaeus</dfn>, <b>1758</b>): breeds are found in the southeastern United States</li>
        <li><b>P. c. pallidior</b>  (<dfn>Mearns</dfn>, <b>1911</b>): breeds are found in south central US and northern Mexico</li>

       <h2>Description</h2>
       <br>
       <p><span class=firstletter>T</span>he <b>painted bunting</b> <i>(Passerina ciris)</i>  is described as the most beautiful bird in North America, it's nickname is <i>nonpareil</i>, which meaning is <q>without equal</q>. <br> 
        A colourful bird easy to identify with a dark blue head, green back, red backside, and underbody. <br>
        The yellow-green <i>females</i> can be much harder to spot and identify as they use their yellow-green plumage to camouglage with their surroundings, like wise the male counterparts can also be difficult to spot as they hide in foliage.<br><br>
        Compared to other similar songbirds, the adult <i>female</i> can still be distinquished by its color being a brigher, truer green.<br>
        Once they become adults painted buntings generally measure 12-14 cm (<i>4.7-5.5 in</i>) in length, span 21-23 cm (<i>8.3-9.1 in</i>) across the wings and weigh 13-19 g (<i>0.46-0.67 oz</i>).<br>
        <br>
        In the first autumn of life, they will begin to molt to yeild a like adult female plumage, a month or so later replacing the juvenile plumage with formative.<br>
        When laying their eggs, they will build cup-shaped nests built in brush or low trees, with the eggs presenting a pale blue-white speckle, or spotted with brown.<br>
        Laying around 3-5 eggs from <strong>March - July</strong>, they migrate to the north to breed for the summer returning to warmer climate in the south for the winter months.

          <h2>Conservation</h2>
          <br>
          <p><span class=firstletter>T</span>hese songbirds commonly breed in the coastal Southeast and in the south-central <strong><abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr></strong>, where they can be willing come to feeders. So you can help the conservation of these species, as they eat seeds once the breeding season is over, starting in midsummer they will visit backyards with low-dense vegetation. <br>
          <br>
            Unfortunately, since they are so eye catching, particularly in Mexico and the Caribbean, they will be often caught and sold illegally as cage birds, which puts pressure on their breeding populations as the <i>males</i> will be targeted for their bright color.<br>
          In the mid <strong>1800's</strong> it was reported that <q>thousands</q> of the colorful birds were caught in the spring to be shipped to europe where they would receive <i>100x</i> the price as cagebirds.</p>

        <br>
        <h2>Behavior</h2>
        <br>
        <p><span class=firstletter>T</span>he <i>Male</i> <b>Painted Bunting</b> will sing from a high exposed perch to advise their territories amongst the others. Also engaging in visual displays in which they will act similar to a butterfly, flying with a bounce in an upright display, showing off body fluff, bow and wing-quiver display. <br>
          <br>
        These displays are used in conflict with other competing males, and also as a breeding display for <i>females</i> to attract a mate. While <i>females</i> are rarely seen to engage in any display, <i>Males</i> can occasionally clash during these displays and on occurance kill eachother during the conflict. This practice along with illegal poaching can add additional pressure on the population for breeding.</p>
